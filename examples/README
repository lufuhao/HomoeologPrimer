### install SAMtools, muscle, primer3
### samtools, muscle and primer3_core should be in PATH

### Run pipeline; it would take a few minutes

bash pipeline.sh

### You will see three folders are created and in each folder there is a cluster.*.primers file

###You should see all the primers it designed
###SeqID	Index	F/R	start	len	tm	gc%	any_th	3'_th	hairpin	seq	Across_Exons


### Skills for primer selection
### 1. start- positions NOT closed to the cDNA ends, because mRNA/cDNA degradation during your experiments
### 2. small any_th
### 3. small 3'_th
### 4. smaller hairpin, at least less than <= (tm-10)
### 5. try to avoid the same >3 bases, like '***AAAA*****', '****TTTTT******', because primer synthesis may be not so precise
### 6. for cDNA, primers better across exons considering genomic DNA contaminations
